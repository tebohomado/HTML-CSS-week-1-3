HTML:
The internet uses three main languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, organizes a website's content. It tells computers about different parts of the page and gives access to various browser features through specific code.

CSS:
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, acts like a designer for web pages. It decides how everything looks, including colors, fonts, and sizes. It can also add fun animations and interactions to make things more interesting.

JavaScript:
JavaScript is a programming language that creates interactive features. When you see a fancy website with cool functions, JavaScript is often working behind the scenes, making everything run smoothly. It's like the superhero of programming languages.

Text Formatting in HTML:
HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets to structure web pages. These tags mark different elements, and entire documents are just a bunch of nested elements.

Paragraphs and Headlines:
To make paragraphs, use <p> tags before and after the text. Headlines come in six types, from <h1> to <h6>, each with its own style.

Bold and Italics:
To make text bold, use <strong> tags, and for italics, use <i> or <em> tags.

Lists:
HTML has different types of lists: unordered lists (<ul>), ordered lists (<ol>), and definition lists (<dl>).

Quotes and Code:
HTML can display quotes using <blockquote> tags and code using <pre> tags.

Superscripts, Subscripts, and Small Text:
For superscripts, use <sup> tags, and for subscripts, use <sub> tags. To make text smaller, use <small> tags.

Troubleshooting and Debugging:
Browsers like Safari and Chrome have developer tools that help debug HTML code. You can also learn from other websites' structures using these tools.

Attributes:
HTML elements can have attributes like class and ID, which help style and identify them.

ARIA Roles:
ARIA roles and attributes improve web accessibility, especially for users with disabilities.

Navigation and Linking:
To create links, use the <a> (anchor) element with an href attribute containing the URL.

URL Pathways:
To link to external websites, use the <a> element with an href attribute containing the full URL.
